<!--One of Angular's defining features is two-way data binding.-->
<!--There's a connection between view and model that keeps data consistent between the two.-->
<!--When view or model is changed, the other changes as well.-->

<!--angular.js file constantly scans DOM for angular attributes i.e. ng-xxx-->

    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.1/angular.js"></script>
    <script src="./app.js"></script>

<body ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="MyController as ctrl"> 
<!--ng-app tells Angular that body tag is root element of Angular app.-->
    <!--As such, html within body will be evaluated by Angular.-->

<!--ng-controller makes ctrl an alias or name for the $scope object.-->
<!--Anything in our html view that is bound to the ctrl alias is bound directly to MyController's "this" syntax.-->

    <h1>
        {{ctrl.greeting}} <!--Bound directly to MyController's "this".-->
    </h1>

    <input ng-model="ctrl.name">
    {{ctrl.name}} <!--Bound directly to MyController's "this".-->

<!--You can have multiple controllers controlling different views.-->
<!--Controllers can also be nested within other controllers.-->
    <!--Instead of controller as, you can use $scope. That's the old Angular way.-->
    <!--$scope syntax allows each child controller access to its parents' properties - like Javascript.-->
    <!--Controller as method makes scope bound to the controller object.-->

    <div ng-controller="CtrlOne as ctrlOne">
        {{ctrlOne.greeting}}
    </div>

    <div ng-controller="CtrlTwo as ctrlTwo">
        {{ctrlTwo.greeting}}
    </div>
