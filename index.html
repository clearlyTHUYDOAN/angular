<!--One of Angular's defining features is two-way data binding.-->
<!--There's a connection between view and model that keeps data consistent between the two.-->
<!--When view or model is changed, the other changes as well.-->

<!--angular.js file constantly scans DOM for angular attributes i.e. ng-xxx-->

<!--ng-app tells Angular that body tag is root element of Angular app.-->
    <!--As such, html within body will be evaluated by Angular.-->

<!--ng-controller makes ctrl an alias for the $scope object.-->
<!--Anything in our html view that is bound to the ctrl alias is bound directly to MyController's "this" syntax.-->
